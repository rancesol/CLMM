The LSST-DESC Cluster Lensing Mass Modeling (CLMM) code is a Python library for performing galaxy cluster mass reconstruction from weak lensing observables. CLMM is associated with Key Tasks _DC1 SW+RQ_ and _DC2 SW_ of the LSST-DESC [Science Roadmap](https://lsstdesc.org/sites/default/files/DESC_SRM_V1_4.pdf) pertaining to absolute and relative mass calibration.
<!---CLMM is descended from [clmassmod](https://github.com/deapplegate/clmassmod) but distinguished by its modular structure and scope, which encompasses both simulated data sets with a known truth and observed data from which we aim to discover the truth.--->
The documentation of the code can be found [here](http://lsstdesc.org/CLMM/).

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>

CLMM requires Python version 3.6 or later.  CLMM has the following dependencies:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) (1.17 or later)
- [SciPy](http://www.numpy.org/) (1.3 or later)
- [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org/) (3.x or later for units and cosmology dependence)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (for plotting and going through tutorials)

```
  pip install numpy scipy astropy matplotlib
```

For the theoretical predictions of the signal, CLMM relies on existing libraries and **at least one of the following must be installed as well**:

- [cluster-toolkit](https://cluster-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [CCL](https://ccl.readthedocs.io/en/v2.0.0/)
- [NumCosmo](https://numcosmo.github.io/)

(See the [INSTALL documentation](INSTALL.md) for more detailed installation instructions.)

For developers, you will also need to install:

- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) (3.x or later for testing)
- [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html) (for documentation)

These are also pip installable:
```
  pip install pytest sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme
```
Note, the last item, `sphinx_rtd_theme` is to make the docs.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

To install CLMM you currently need to build it from source:

```
  git clone https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CLMM.git
  cd CLMM
  python setup.py install --user   # Add --user flag to install it locally
```
See the [INSTALL documentation](INSTALL.md) for more detailed installation instructions.

To run the tests you can do:

  `pytest`
